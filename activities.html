    1. Visit the animals at Copenhagen Zoo
Copenhagen Zoo has the claim to fame of being one of the oldest zoos in the whole of Europe and it was first opened in 1859. The zoo sprawls over 27 acres of land and you find 264 different species here as over 3,000 animals call the zoo home.

The area is made up of different sections such as the Tropical Zoo which spans 1,500 square meters and mimics the conditions of the rainforest and you will find animals like deer, snakes, and crocodiles here as well as a butterfly garden.

For younger visitors there is a Children’s Zoo and you can get up close with the animals like dwarf goats from Africa.

2. Discover Thy National Park
The National Park is the first official national park in Denmark and spans 12 kilometers of land along the western coastline of Jutland.

Here you will find rugged landscapes as well as vast pine forests and bracing sea air.

Hiking and biking are both popular activities in the park and you can amble over scenic sand dunes as you take in the local flora and fauna.

Birdwatchers are also in for a treat as there are over 30 species of birds in the park, as well as resident otters.

In addition to the wildlife found here you can also take in the grave mounds that dot the site and date from the Bronze Age.

3. Climb the Råbjerg Mile
Nestled near Skagen in the North Jutland region is that largest moving sand dune in all of Northern Europe.

The Råbjerg Mile moves at a rate of around 18 meters per year, and you can still see the path that it has carved in the surrounding landscapes as the sands have rumbled past.

This is one of the premium tourist attractions in Denmark and more than 250,000 people come here annually to marvel at this amazing feat of nature.

4. Visit Egeskov Castle in Funen
Egeskov is one of the most beautiful and famous buildings in Europe and is built in the Renaissance style.

Points of interest to look out for if you come here include the mighty Knights’ Hall as well as elegant spires and a working moat.

The area around the castle is as famous as the interior and you will find a large forest dotted with local buildings and trails.

There is also a Segway course here if you feel like something a little more relaxing.

5. Stand in the northernmost spot of Grenen
Most people won’t know that the northernmost point in Denmark is Grenen.

As you stand looking over the water here you will be able to see the spot where the Skagerrak and Kattegat seas meet and crash together as they break over the Skaw Reef.

This area is known as the tip of the European mainland and you will be able to watch the resident seals at play as well as enjoy the beach which has some of the best coastline in the country.

6. Visit a buried church in Skagen
The seaside area of Skagen is the home of Den Tilsandede Kirke or the sand buried church.

It is dedicated to Saint Laurence who is the saint of seafarer’s and it dates from the 14th century.

In the days gone by this would have been the largest church in the region but the nearby sands have drifted here over the years, starting in the 17th century, and started to cover the building.

The church was finally closed in 1795 when the sands overtook it to the point where it could no longer be used and now only the main tower can be seen poking out of the dunes.
