        <p class="actOpening">
            Many people know it as simply Denmark, but this is actually the Kingdom of Denmark thanks to the Royal Family that has resided here for centuries and made this a sovereign state. As a result, palaces and castles feature heavily on the landscape, and if you are a history buff then there is a huge amount to enjoy.<br><br>

Arguably a number of the best attractions in Denmark however happen out of doors, as this country is home to some of the most stunning natural sights on earth, such as floating sand dunes that change location every year and majestic cliffs that bring with them 65 million years worth of history. As if that wasn’t enough, you can explore some of the islands off the main coast of the country, where you will find vast pine forests, wild horses, and relaxing seals. Depending on your interests, you can take a trip back in time to learn all about the Viking roots of the smallest country in Nordic region, or fast forward into the future at some of the most cutting edge museums in the world such as the Maritime Museum or the AroS Art Museum.
