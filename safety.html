    <h1>Safety</h1>
        <h2>Terrorism</h2>
        <p>Denmark has set its terror threat level at 'significant' (level 4 of 5).
           <br><br>
           The threat of right-wing extremism is rising, and ISIL-inspired extremism continues to be a threat.
           <br><br>
           In the past few years, authorities have arrested several people suspected of planning terrorist attacks.
           <br><br>
           Terrorists are likely to keep planning attacks in Denmark.
           <br><br>
           Terrorists have staged attacks in several European cities. Targets have included:
        <ul>
            <li>aviation</li>
            <li>public transport and transport hubs</li>
            <li>sporting venues</li>
            <li>places of mass gathering, including those popular with travellers</li>
        </ul>
           <br><br>
           To protect yourself from terrorism:
        <ul>
            <li>be alert to possible threats, especially in public places</li>
            <li>report any suspicious activity or items to the police</li>
            <li>monitor local news</li>
            <li>take official warnings seriously</li>
            <li>do what the local authorities ask you to do</li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.
            <br><br>
            Terrorism is a threat worldwide.
            <br><br>

        </ul></p>
        <h2>Crime</h2>
            <p>Serious crime is low. Pickpockets often target people in tourist areas. This includes hotel lobbies and public transport in and around Copenhagen.
            <br><br>
            Pickpockets and bag-snatchers sometimes work together to target people.
            <br><br>
            There's some gang-related crime in Copenhagen, especially in Christiania.
            <br><br>
            There's a strict 'no photography' policy in Christiania. Travellers have been <a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted">assaulted</a> and robbed for taking photographs. 
            <br><br>
            Take care of your personal belongings, especially on public transport, at national landmarks, museums, railway stations and restaurants. Keep your passport in a safe place.</p>
        <h2>Civil unrest and political tension</h2>
            <p>Demonstrations and large public gatherings are not common. However, they can turn violent.
               <br><br>
               Monitor the media and plan your travel to avoid affected areas.
               <br><br>
               If civil unrest affects the area you're in, follow the advice of local authorities.
               <br><br>

        <h2>Climate and natural disasters</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident">Severe weather</a> can impact your travel. Monitor local media for updates.
                <br><br>
                Although Denmark is not prone to extreme weather or natural disasters, travellers to Greenland or the Faroe Islands should plan accordingly.
                <br><br>
                Some places in the Arctic are a long way from mobile coverage and help, including:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>search and rescue</li>
                <li>evacuation</li>
                <li>medical facilities</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
                Search and rescue teams in the region are highly skilled. However, in an emergency, help depends on the weather and sea conditions. If you need assistance, you may have to wait a long time.
                <br><br>
                If severe weather affects the area you're visiting:
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li>confirm plans and activities with your tour operator or travel provider</li>
                <li>check the condition of buildings and facilities with local tour operators and hotels</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
                Register with the <a href="https://www.gdacs.org/">Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System</a> to receive alerts on major disasters.</p>
    <h1>Health</h1>
        <h2>Travel insurance</h2>
            <p>Get comprehensive <a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance">travel insurance</a> before you leave. 
               <br><br>
               Your policy must cover all overseas medical costs, including COVID-19 and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.
               <br><br>
               If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.
               <br><br>
               If you're not insured, you may have to pay up-front for medical care.
               <br><br>
               Confirm:
            <ul>
               <li>what activities and care your policy covers, taking particular care to check for COVID-19 coverage</li>
               <li>that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away, including any potential quarantine periods</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h2>Physical and mental health</h2>
            <p>Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. Consider whether you may be in a vulnerable category for COVID-19.
                <br><br>
                See your doctor or travel clinic to:
            <ul>
                <li>have a basic health check-up</li>
                <li>ask if your travel plans may affect your health</li>
                <li>plan any vaccinations you need</li>
            </ul>
                Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.
                <br><br>
                If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas">nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate</a> to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

        <h2>Medications</h2>
            <p>Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.
               <br><br>
               If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal with the <a href="https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/pharmacies/medicines-imported-from-abroad/medicines-for-human-use/are-you-bringing-medicine-into-denmark/">Danish Medicines Agency</a>
               <br><br>    
               Take enough legal medication for your trip.
               <br><br>    
               Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:
            <ul>
               <li>what the medication is</li>
               <li>how much you'll take</li>
               <li>that it's for personal use</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Health risks</h2>
            <h3>COVID-19</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19">COVID-19</a> remains a risk in Denmark.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://coronaprover.dk/Home/Welcome">COVID-19 tests</a> are available.
                <br><br>
                The <a href="https://www.sst.dk/en/English/corona-eng">Danish Health Authority (Sundhedsstyrelsen)</a> provides answers to frequently asked questions, provides hygiene advice and maintains <a href="https://www.sst.dk/en/English/Corona-eng/Further-information/Hotlines">COVID-19 hotlines</a> that you can contact for advice.
                <br><br>
                Restrictions are subject to frequent change. Up-to-date information is available on Denmark's official <a href="https://en.coronasmitte.dk/">COVID-19 website</a> or through the official helpline on +45 70 20 60 44.
                <br><br>
                You should consult your local health professional for advice on vaccine options, including assistance that may be available locally. The Australian Government can't provide advice on the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines that have been approved for use outside of Australia's regulatory process.
                <br><br>

            <h3>Monkeypox</h3>
                <p>Denmark has experienced cases of <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/monkeypox-mpx">Monkeypox.</a> Follow <a href="https://www.ssi.dk/sygdomme-beredskab-og-forskning/sygdomsleksikon/a/abekopper">local advice</a> and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms.
                <br><br>
                Local doctors can prescribe a test for Monkeypox if you are experiencing symptoms or have been in close contact with an infected individual. Denmark provides vaccinations for people who have been in close contact with an infected individual and people from specific risk groups.
                <br><br>
                <b>Other health risks</b>
                <br><br>
                Other health risks in Denmark are broadly similar to those in Australia.</p>
        <h2>Medical care</h2>
            <h3>Medical facilities</h3>
                <p>The standard of medical facilities is similar to Australia. Major hospitals are in Copenhagen, Aarhus and the Odense area. English is widely spoken.
                    <br><br>
                    Australia doesn't have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Denmark.
                    <br><br>
                    Costs are similar to, or more than private treatment in Australia.
                    <br><br>
                    Emergency hospital treatment is usually free, but you need to pay the follow-up costs.</p>
