            Copenhagen
        </h1>
        <p>
            Copenhagen, Danish København, capital and largest city of Denmark. 
            It is located on the islands of Zealand (Sjælland) and Amager, at the southern end of The Sound (Øresund).
            <br><br>
            A small village existed on the site of the present city by the early 10th century. 
            In 1167 Bishop Absalon of Roskilde built a castle on an islet off the coast and fortified the town with ramparts 
            and a moat. In 1445 Copenhagen was made the capital of Denmark and the residence of the royal family. 
            In the civil and religious conflicts of the Protestant Reformation, the town was often sacked. 
            During the late 16th century Copenhagen’s trade began to flourish, and the city itself expanded. 
            Among the new buildings erected were the Børsen (Exchange), the Holmens Church, Trinitatis Church, 
            with the adjacent famous Round Tower, and the castle of Rosenborg (now the museum of the royal family). 
            During the wars with Sweden (1658–60) Copenhagen was besieged for two years. 
            Fires in 1728 and 1795 destroyed many houses and buildings, and in 1807 the city was bombarded by the British. 
            The ramparts were pulled down in 1856. Since then the city has expanded still further and incorporated many 
            of the adjacent districts.

        <img src="Images/Tivoli Garden.png" height="300px" width="100%" class="cover"/>
        <p>
            Walking from Town Hall Square and crossing H.C. Andersens Boulevard brings you to the inspiration behind the 
            Disney theme parks: the famous Tivoli amusement park and pleasure gardens dating from 1843.
            <br><br>
            It's impossible to miss the grand entrance at Vesterbrogade. 
            Here, visitors are welcomed through a dramatic archway flanked by columns. 
            No matter what time of year you visit, Tivoli feels festive.
            <br><br>
            Inside the gardens, you'll wind your way through a village complete with cute shops and a lake adorned 
            by well lit trees that are mirrored serenely in the water. That's likely the only serenity you'll 
            find in this miniature theme park, which brings out the kid in every visitor.
            <br><br>
            Here, you'll also find more than 20 attractions, including a roller coaster; roundabouts; halls of mirrors; 
            pantomime, puppet, and open-air theaters; a wealth of restaurants and cafés; flower gardens; 
            and a Moorish-styled concert hall, which is particularly pleasing when lit up at night.

        <p>
            An easy 10-minute walk from Tivoli along Vestergade brings you to the National Museum (Nationalmuseet), 
            a must-see attraction for anyone with an interest in Danish history and culture.
            <br><br>
            Some impressive runic stones are on display here, and the Danish history collection includes a sun chariot 
            (cult object in the form of a cart) that is more than 2,000 years old, Romanesque and Gothic church fittings, 
            Danish porcelain and silver, and collections of antiquities and coins.
            <br><br>
            The ethnographical collection, including items from Greenland, gives an excellent impression of life among the 
            Eskimos. Inside, you'll also find collections from other interesting areas including, Asia, Africa and Oceania, 
            as well as the culture of the Indians.

        <p>
            Although you won't likely notice this from the ground, Den Bla Planet (a.k.a. the National Aquarium Denmark) 
            was built to resemble a whirlpool. Think that's cool? Head inside where the aquarium's wow factor is even more 
            impressive!
            <br><br>
            The largest aquarium in Northern Europe, Den Bla Planet is one of the best attractions in Copenhagen. 
            The building's aluminum-covered walls evoke rolling ocean waves while the aquarium's inner pathways flow like 
            tributaries from the central core through eight sections.
            <br><br>
            These paths are lined by close to 50 aquariums and installations that house everything from eagle rays to turtles 
            to hammerhead sharks to seahorses to moray eels to alligators. There is no shortage of creatures to see here.
            <br><br>
            Whether you're hoping to spot ocean animals up close or are interested in the marine life that call tropical 
            rivers and lakes home, you're sure to find something inspiring in this venue. Watch the otters play, 
            touch a creature in the tropical touch pool, or visit the café for a treat.

        <p>
            A stroll of around five minutes from Christiansborg takes you to the bustling shopping area of Strøget where 
            you'll find a wealth of boutiques, cafés, and restaurants.
            <br><br>
            Strøget, a nickname from the 1800s, consists of several roads crisscrossing one another, 
            beginning at Town Hall Square (Rådhuspladsen) and ending at Kongens Nytorv. 
            Some adjoining streets on the north have also been pedestrianized.
            <br><br>
            International brand-name stores such as Max Mara, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Hermès tend to be at the end of 
            the street facing the direction of Kongens Nytorv. Follow Strøget towards City Hall 
            Square for more affordable shopping at H&M, Weekday, and Zara.

        </h1>
        <p>
            Frederiksberg is a part of the Capital Region of Denmark. 
            It is formally an independent municipality, Frederiksberg Municipality, 
            separate from Copenhagen Municipality, but both are a part of the City of Copenhagen. 
            It occupies an area of less than 9 km2 and had a population of 103,192 in 2015.
            <br><br>
            Frederiksberg is an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen Municipality. 
            Some sources ambiguously refer to Frederiksberg as a quarter or neighbourhood of Copenhagen, 
            being one of the four municipalities that constitute the City of Copenhagen (the other three being Copenhagen, 
            Tårnby and Dragør).[5] However, Frederiksberg has its own mayor and municipal council, and is fiercely independent.

        <img src="Images/cisternerne.jpg" height="300px" width="100%" class="cover"/>
        <p>
            Forget everything about traditional art museums and exhibition spaces. 
            Nowhere else in Denmark does art become one with the physical surroundings to such an extent as here!
            <br><br>
            Today Cisternerne is a subterranean art space, where you can withdraw from daily life, where time stands still, 
            and where the mobile signal doesn’t reach. When the cold climate in Cisternerne embraces you, you are not simply 
            looking at art – you are completely immersed in art. 
            <br><br>
            The old reservoir is sparsely illuminated, and the atmosphere evokes fascination and enchantment in both children 
            and adults.  Every year we invite an internationally recognized artist or architect to create an exhibition 
            particularly to this underground space – an exhibition in large scale that interacts with and emphasizes the 
            unique architecture, climate, atmosphere and history of Cisternerne.
            <br><br>
            The art projects that unfold in Cisternerne are site-specific and cannot be built or rebuilt any other place 
            in the world.

            Between Valby and Copenhagen you find Søndermarken – one of Frederiksberg’s many parks offering space and 
            beautiful nature.
            <br><br>
            Here you find wild plants, long meadow-like grass and even owls in the old trees. 
            The locals use Søndermarken for jogging, walking the dog or just strolling in the hilly and forest filled 
            landscape. You can also visit the playground with your children or experience the cisterns that used to be water 
            basins supplying clean water to the Copenhageners.

        <p>
            The Danish Music Museum has existed since 1898, making it one of the oldest museums of musical history in the world. 
            It features a comprehensive collection of European, Asian, South American and African musical instruments dating 
            from the 16th to the 20th centuries as well as a library, archives and a comprehensive collection of visual art.
            <br><br>
            In the new surroundings, the Danish Music museum will have more room for both exhibitions, 
            the library and educational activities.
            <br><br>
            The museum also launches its new initiative “The Sound Room”, where children of all ages can have a try at 
            playing everything from the harp and the kettledrum to the electrical guitar and the xylophone.
            <br><br>
            When you visit the many exhibitions, you may come across quaint instruments such as the 'amoeba-shaped violin, 
            'the giraffe piano', and the 'sausage bassoon'.

        <p>
            Charlottenlund Fort isn’t just an old military fort. It is also an exciting and beautiful park with a popular 
            swimming beach and bathhouse. It lies between Charlottenlund Forest and the Sound, and its open green spaces 
            provide the setting for a host of leisure activities. It affords opportunities for sunbathing, play, ball games, 
            picnics and a dip in the waves of the Sound.
            <br><br>
            The fort was built below Charlottenlund Palace as part of the fortifications around Copenhagen 
            in the years 1886-88. In 1910 it was converted into a regular søfort and was one of the forts designed to 
            protect Copenhagen from attacks from the sea.
            <br><br>
            Today, both the fort and its surroundings at the beach park is a popular recreation area, 
            which has been used for the organization of concerts. Inside the fort area behind the ramparts is a campground,

        <p>
            Less than 46 kilometers from the capital city of Copenhagen, Helsingor is primarily a busy ferry port. 
            Countless Swedes make the trip across the short stretch of water from Helsingborg for cheap supplies and 
            simply to enjoy a day out.
            <br><br>
            Yet, this unassuming town has plenty of things to do. One of the reasons it's such a popular place to visit is 
            its Shakespearean past. For this is Elsinore, home to Hamlet's castle, the mighty Kronborg.
            <br><br>
            The medieval quarter is particularly pleasant place to visit on foot and has some fascinating buildings, 
            such as the beautifully preserved Carmelite Monastery (Karmeliterklostret) attached to St. Mary's Church 
            (Sankt Mariæ Kirke). Throughout the streets of the old town, you'll find boutiques, atmospheric cafés,

        <p>
            A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kronborg Castle is the setting of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the top tourist attraction 
            in Helsingor. In the northeast of town, on a peninsula in the Øresund (the sound on which Helsingor sits), 
            the towering castle is plainly visible from afar.
            <br><br>
            Originally, a fortress built around 1420 by Eric of Pomerania stood here. A new castle, a four-winged building 
            with an enclosed inner courtyard, was built between 1574 and 1584 under Frederick II. After a catastrophic fire 
            in 1629, King Christian IV had the castle rebuilt between 1635 and 1640.#
            <br><br>
            For more than 100 years, the structure served as a garrison and, in 1924, it was renovated. The Castle Chapel 
            lies in the South Wing with a splendid Renaissance interior and woodcarvings from Germany. 
            The North Wing contains the great Ballroom or Knights' Hall. Superb tapestries are on display in the West Wing.

            Just three kilometers from the town center, and in a fittingly industrialised zone, you'll find this privately 
            funded museum dedicated to Denmark's impressive technological achievements. Stretching over some 8,000 meters, 
            the museum is housed in a former iron foundry dating from the 1960s.
            <br><br>
            There's a comprehensive collection of steam engines, various inventions, electrical appliances, bicycles, 
            vintage cars, and aeroplanes. Alongside all this, the museum is home to a functioning pewter workshop and 
            exhibits dedicated to the discovery of electromagnetism and the "Telegraphone," the forefather of modern tape 
            recording.

            The aviation section, with more than 30 flying machines, including one that's claimed to be the first ever to 
            take flight in Europe (sadly unrecorded), is particularly interesting.

            Built in 1559, the striking red brick Gothic cathedral of St. Olaf's (Sankt Olai) nestles in the heart of town. 
            Named after the Norwegian King Olav, who was canonised, the church is adorned with various depictions of him.
            <br><br>
            The building, originally a church, but consecrated as a cathedral in 1961, was completed in 1559, however its 
            history dates back to the 13th century. Remains of ancient decorations adorning the old Romanesque chapel that 
            once stood here can still be seen in the north wall of the nave. Other points of interest include Dutch alabaster 
            altarpieces, the beautifully carved pulpit, and a number of frescoes.

            Frederiksborg Castle is beautifully situated on three small islets in the Castle Lake in Hillerød. 
            Within the castle’s walls there are major cultural attractions for the whole family, while the highly picturesque 
            setting is perfect for peaceful walks in the gardens and boat trips.
            <br><br>
            Frederiksborg Castle was built by King Christian IV in the early decades of the 17th century and is the largest 
            Renaissance complex in the Nordic region. The aim of the building was to show off and enhance Christian IV’s 
            status as a powerful European monarch. Accordingly the castle is richly adorned with symbolic and decorative 
            elements: for example, the impressive Neptune Fountain and the Marble Gallery of the King’s Wing.
            <br><br>
            Since 1878 Frederiksborg Castle has housed The Museum of National History, which presents 500 years of Danish 
            history with a collection of portraits, history paintings, furniture and applied art. The Museum was established 
            by the founder of Carlsberg, brewer J. C. Jacobsen, and ever since has been an independent department of the 
            Carlsberg Foundation.

            Denmark's second largest city, Aarhus (or Århus) lies on the east coast of Jutland, where the river Aarhus Å flows 
            into the picturesque bay of the same name. First mentioned in 928 CE as the seat of a Bishop, it received its 
            municipal charter in 1441.
            <br><br>
            From the Middle Ages onwards, it served as an important commercial, seafaring, and fishing center, a tradition that 
            lives on due to the area's popularity among sports anglers. The wealth generated by merchants during the city's 
            early heyday is clear today in the many well-preserved Renaissance buildings you'll see as you explore its many 
            tourist attractions.
            <br><br>
            To find evidence of an even earlier era, stroll through Klostergade, Volden, and Borggade in the Latin Quarter. 
            This interesting neighborhood replaced the old Viking fortifications in the late 14th century. But this quarter 
            is far from frozen in time. Today, it's a lively enclave, with boutiques, cafés, and restaurants lining its narrow 
            stone-paved streets.
            <br><br>
            An important cultural center with an outstanding fine arts museum, Aarhus is also well known for its vibrant music 
            scene. Frequent concerts and festivals embrace everything from folk, jazz, rock, and pop, to chamber music and 
            operatic performances held in historic venues and churches.

            Dating from the 16th to the early 20th century, this remarkable collection has been assembled as if it really was 
            an authentic "old town." The effect is further enhanced by the fact these superb old houses, shops, workshops, 
            and windmills still function just as they did in the past and serve as a time capsule preserving a bygone era.
            <br><br>
            Highlights of a visit include seeing the former Burgomaster's house from 1597, a remarkably well-preserved 
            building that is home to a fine collection of furniture. Also notable are the merchant's house, a stilt-house,

            The museum, founded in 1977, is housed since 2009 in an iconic 60,000 square-foot / 5,600 square-meter building 
            designed by acclaimed American architect Steven Holl. The museum was designed by Holl as a fluid-shaped 
            single-story building with reflective pools positioned in front of its south side. 
            The architect was inspired by the presence in the site of a 1960 circular construction that currently 
            houses part of the art collection of the HEART and once was a shirt factory. Therefore, Holl designed 
            a new building whose shape <i>“resembles a collection of shirtsleeves viewed from above”</i>.
            <br><br>
            The museum’s collection is focused on modern and contemporary Danish and international art, from the 1930s onward – 
            with a special focus on Italian post-war art and Arte Povera, and on concrete and constructive art – 
            including works by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Fontana, Mario Merz, Joseph Beuys, Jannis Kounellis, Ole Schwalbe,

            Søby Brunkulslejer (brown coal field) is situated by Søby in Kølkær parish aprox. 15 km south from Herning. 
            The brown coal fields cover a listed area at around 1000 hectare and it is estimated that there has been produced 
            around 50 million cubic metres of brown coal from the period 1940 - 1970.
            <br><br>
            Today, the area is a hilly nature area with lots of small lakes, but some of the area is dangerous to go to since 
            there are risks of slides.
            <br><br>
            North of Søby lies Søby sø which is not from the brown coal-digging but a natural heath lake.
            In 1939, the production in the fields started out little by little. At first it was by hand, shovel, wheelbarrow, 
            spade and horse carriage. Later the hand tools were supplemented with excavators and conveyer belts.
            <br><br>
            Quickly, a town developed around the fields - the houses being small sheds and barracks, railway carriages and 
            worn-out coaches. The area was called The Jutlandic Klondike.

        <p>
            Randers is a city in Randers Municipality, Central Denmark Region on the Jutland 
            peninsula. It is Denmark's sixth-largest city, with a population of 62,802. Randers is the municipality's main 
            town and the site of its municipal council. By road it is 38.5 kilometres (23.9 mi) north of Aarhus, 43.8 
            kilometres (27.2 mi) east of Viborg, and 224 kilometres (139 mi) northwest of Copenhagen.
            <br><br>
            Randers became a thriving market town in medieval times, and many of its 15th-century half-timbered houses remain 
            today, as does St Martin's Church, also from that period. Trade by sea was facilitated through the Gudenå River, 
            entering Randers Fjord. During industrialization, Randers quickly became one of the most important industrial 
            towns in the country, but it saw itself outpaced by the cities of Aarhus and Aalborg at the beginning of the 20th 
            century. Most of the larger historic industries in Randers are gone today. From 1970, the population saw a decline 
            from a peak of 58,500 citizens, until a stabilization in the 1990s occurred, followed by a modest rise since then.
            <br><br>
            The main tourist attraction is Randers Tropical Zoo thanks to its artificial rainforest, the largest in Northern 
            Europe, its 350 varieties of plant and over 175 species of animals. The city's football team, Randers FC, play 
            their homes games at the AutoC Park Randers, and are in Denmark's first league, the Superligaen. The town is also 
            home to Randers rugby union club and Jutland RLFC, a rugby league team, as well as Randers Cimbria, a Basketligaen 
            team that took 2nd place in the 2013–2014 season.
