            Copenhagen
        </h1>
        <p>
            Copenhagen, Danish København, capital and largest city of Denmark. 
            It is located on the islands of Zealand (Sjælland) and Amager, at the southern end of The Sound (Øresund).
            <br><br>
            A small village existed on the site of the present city by the early 10th century. 
            In 1167 Bishop Absalon of Roskilde built a castle on an islet off the coast and fortified the town with ramparts 
            and a moat. In 1445 Copenhagen was made the capital of Denmark and the residence of the royal family. 
            In the civil and religious conflicts of the Protestant Reformation, the town was often sacked. 
            During the late 16th century Copenhagen’s trade began to flourish, and the city itself expanded. 
            Among the new buildings erected were the Børsen (Exchange), the Holmens Church, Trinitatis Church, 
            with the adjacent famous Round Tower, and the castle of Rosenborg (now the museum of the royal family). 
            During the wars with Sweden (1658–60) Copenhagen was besieged for two years. 
            Fires in 1728 and 1795 destroyed many houses and buildings, and in 1807 the city was bombarded by the British. 
            The ramparts were pulled down in 1856. Since then the city has expanded still further and incorporated many 
            of the adjacent districts.

        <p>
            Walking from Town Hall Square and crossing H.C. Andersens Boulevard brings you to the inspiration behind the 
            Disney theme parks: the famous Tivoli amusement park and pleasure gardens dating from 1843.
            <br><br>
            It's impossible to miss the grand entrance at Vesterbrogade. 
            Here, visitors are welcomed through a dramatic archway flanked by columns. 
            No matter what time of year you visit, Tivoli feels festive.
            <br><br>
            Inside the gardens, you'll wind your way through a village complete with cute shops and a lake adorned 
            by well lit trees that are mirrored serenely in the water. That's likely the only serenity you'll 
            find in this miniature theme park, which brings out the kid in every visitor.
            <br><br>
            Here, you'll also find more than 20 attractions, including a roller coaster; roundabouts; halls of mirrors; 
            pantomime, puppet, and open-air theaters; a wealth of restaurants and cafés; flower gardens; 
            and a Moorish-styled concert hall, which is particularly pleasing when lit up at night.

        <p>
            An easy 10-minute walk from Tivoli along Vestergade brings you to the National Museum (Nationalmuseet), 
            a must-see attraction for anyone with an interest in Danish history and culture.
            <br><br>
            Some impressive runic stones are on display here, and the Danish history collection includes a sun chariot 
            (cult object in the form of a cart) that is more than 2,000 years old, Romanesque and Gothic church fittings, 
            Danish porcelain and silver, and collections of antiquities and coins.
            <br><br>
            The ethnographical collection, including items from Greenland, gives an excellent impression of life among the 
            Eskimos. Inside, you'll also find collections from other interesting areas including, Asia, Africa and Oceania, 
            as well as the culture of the Indians.

        <p>
            Although you won't likely notice this from the ground, Den Bla Planet (a.k.a. the National Aquarium Denmark) 
            was built to resemble a whirlpool. Think that's cool? Head inside where the aquarium's wow factor is even more 
            impressive!
            <br><br>
            The largest aquarium in Northern Europe, Den Bla Planet is one of the best attractions in Copenhagen. 
            The building's aluminum-covered walls evoke rolling ocean waves while the aquarium's inner pathways flow like 
            tributaries from the central core through eight sections.
            <br><br>
            These paths are lined by close to 50 aquariums and installations that house everything from eagle rays to turtles 
            to hammerhead sharks to seahorses to moray eels to alligators. There is no shortage of creatures to see here.
            <br><br>
            Whether you're hoping to spot ocean animals up close or are interested in the marine life that call tropical 
            rivers and lakes home, you're sure to find something inspiring in this venue. Watch the otters play, 
            touch a creature in the tropical touch pool, or visit the café for a treat.

            A stroll of around five minutes from Christiansborg takes you to the bustling shopping area of Strøget where 
            you'll find a wealth of boutiques, cafés, and restaurants.
            <br><br>
            Strøget, a nickname from the 1800s, consists of several roads crisscrossing one another, 
            beginning at Town Hall Square (Rådhuspladsen) and ending at Kongens Nytorv. 
            Some adjoining streets on the north have also been pedestrianized.
            <br><br>
            International brand-name stores such as Max Mara, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Hermès tend to be at the end of 
            the street facing the direction of Kongens Nytorv. Follow Strøget towards City Hall 
            Square for more affordable shopping at H&M, Weekday, and Zara.

        </h1>
        <p>
            Frederiksberg is a part of the Capital Region of Denmark. 
            It is formally an independent municipality, Frederiksberg Municipality, 
            separate from Copenhagen Municipality, but both are a part of the City of Copenhagen. 
            It occupies an area of less than 9 km2 and had a population of 103,192 in 2015.
            <br><br>
            Frederiksberg is an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen Municipality. 
            Some sources ambiguously refer to Frederiksberg as a quarter or neighbourhood of Copenhagen, 
            being one of the four municipalities that constitute the City of Copenhagen (the other three being Copenhagen, 
            Tårnby and Dragør).[5] However, Frederiksberg has its own mayor and municipal council, and is fiercely independent.

        <p>
            Forget everything about traditional art museums and exhibition spaces. 
            Nowhere else in Denmark does art become one with the physical surroundings to such an extent as here!
            <br><br>
            Today Cisternerne is a subterranean art space, where you can withdraw from daily life, where time stands still, 
            and where the mobile signal doesn’t reach. When the cold climate in Cisternerne embraces you, you are not simply 
            looking at art – you are completely immersed in art. 
            <br><br>
            The old reservoir is sparsely illuminated, and the atmosphere evokes fascination and enchantment in both children 
            and adults.  Every year we invite an internationally recognized artist or architect to create an exhibition 
            particularly to this underground space – an exhibition in large scale that interacts with and emphasizes the 
            unique architecture, climate, atmosphere and history of Cisternerne.
            <br><br>
            The art projects that unfold in Cisternerne are site-specific and cannot be built or rebuilt any other place 
            in the world.

            beautiful nature.
            <br><br>
            Here you find wild plants, long meadow-like grass and even owls in the old trees. 
            The locals use Søndermarken for jogging, walking the dog or just strolling in the hilly and forest filled 
            landscape. You can also visit the playground with your children or experience the cisterns that used to be water 
            basins supplying clean water to the Copenhageners.

            The Danish Music Museum has existed since 1898, making it one of the oldest museums of musical history in the world. 
            It features a comprehensive collection of European, Asian, South American and African musical instruments dating 
            from the 16th to the 20th centuries as well as a library, archives and a comprehensive collection of visual art.
            <br><br>
            In the new surroundings, the Danish Music museum will have more room for both exhibitions, 
            the library and educational activities.
            <br><br>
            The museum also launches its new initiative “The Sound Room”, where children of all ages can have a try at 
            playing everything from the harp and the kettledrum to the electrical guitar and the xylophone.
            <br><br>
            When you visit the many exhibitions, you may come across quaint instruments such as the 'amoeba-shaped violin,

            Charlottenlund Fort isn’t just an old military fort. It is also an exciting and beautiful park with a popular 
            swimming beach and bathhouse. It lies between Charlottenlund Forest and the Sound, and its open green spaces

            in the years 1886-88. In 1910 it was converted into a regular søfort and was one of the forts designed to 
            protect Copenhagen from attacks from the sea.
            <br><br>
            Today, both the fort and its surroundings at the beach park is a popular recreation area, 
            which has been used for the organization of concerts. Inside the fort area behind the ramparts is a campground, 
            and the violence on the Øresund catering establishment.

            Less than 46 kilometers from the capital city of Copenhagen, Helsingor is primarily a busy ferry port. 
            Countless Swedes make the trip across the short stretch of water from Helsingborg for cheap supplies and 
            simply to enjoy a day out.
            <br><br>
            Yet, this unassuming town has plenty of things to do. One of the reasons it's such a popular place to visit is 
            its Shakespearean past. For this is Elsinore, home to Hamlet's castle, the mighty Kronborg.
            <br><br>
            The medieval quarter is particularly pleasant place to visit on foot and has some fascinating buildings, 
            such as the beautifully preserved Carmelite Monastery (Karmeliterklostret) attached to St. Mary's Church 
            (Sankt Mariæ Kirke). Throughout the streets of the old town, you'll find boutiques, atmospheric cafés, 
            and charming restaurants.

            A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kronborg Castle is the setting of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the top tourist attraction 
            in Helsingor. In the northeast of town, on a peninsula in the Øresund (the sound on which Helsingor sits), 
            the towering castle is plainly visible from afar.
            <br><br>
            Originally, a fortress built around 1420 by Eric of Pomerania stood here. A new castle, a four-winged building 
            with an enclosed inner courtyard, was built between 1574 and 1584 under Frederick II. After a catastrophic fire 
            in 1629, King Christian IV had the castle rebuilt between 1635 and 1640.#
            <br><br>
            For more than 100 years, the structure served as a garrison and, in 1924, it was renovated. The Castle Chapel 
            lies in the South Wing with a splendid Renaissance interior and woodcarvings from Germany. 
            The North Wing contains the great Ballroom or Knights' Hall. Superb tapestries are on display in the West Wing.

            <br><br>
            Frederiksborg Castle was built by King Christian IV in the early decades of the 17th century and is the largest 
            Renaissance complex in the Nordic region. The aim of the building was to show off and enhance Christian IV’s 
            status as a powerful European monarch. Accordingly the castle is richly adorned with symbolic and decorative 
            elements: for example, the impressive Neptune Fountain and the Marble Gallery of the King’s Wing.
            <br><br>
            Since 1878 Frederiksborg Castle has housed The Museum of National History, which presents 500 years of Danish

            Denmark's second largest city, Aarhus (or Århus) lies on the east coast of Jutland, where the river Aarhus Å flows 
            into the picturesque bay of the same name. First mentioned in 928 CE as the seat of a Bishop, it received its 
            municipal charter in 1441.
            <br><br>
            From the Middle Ages onwards, it served as an important commercial, seafaring, and fishing center, a tradition that 
            lives on due to the area's popularity among sports anglers. The wealth generated by merchants during the city's 
            early heyday is clear today in the many well-preserved Renaissance buildings you'll see as you explore its many 
            tourist attractions.

            To find evidence of an even earlier era, stroll through Klostergade, Volden, and Borggade in the Latin Quarter. 
            This interesting neighborhood replaced the old Viking fortifications in the late 14th century. But this quarter 
            is far from frozen in time. Today, it's a lively enclave, with boutiques, cafés, and restaurants lining its narrow

            The museum, founded in 1977, is housed since 2009 in an iconic 60,000 square-foot / 5,600 square-meter building 
            designed by acclaimed American architect Steven Holl. The museum was designed by Holl as a fluid-shaped 
            single-story building with reflective pools positioned in front of its south side. 
            The architect was inspired by the presence in the site of a 1960 circular construction that currently 
            houses part of the art collection of the HEART and once was a shirt factory. Therefore, Holl designed 
            a new building whose shape <i>“resembles a collection of shirtsleeves viewed from above”</i>.
            <br><br>
            The museum’s collection is focused on modern and contemporary Danish and international art, from the 1930s onward – 
            with a special focus on Italian post-war art and Arte Povera, and on concrete and constructive art – 
            including works by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Fontana, Mario Merz, Joseph Beuys, Jannis Kounellis, Ole Schwalbe,

            Carl-Henning Pedersen & Else Alfelts Museum is an artist museum built around a unique collection of the couple's 
            works. Carl-Henning Pedersen donated several thousand of his and his wife's pictures to the city of Herning, 
            which established the museum in 1976. The museum holds a total of more than 6000 works by the two artists.
            <br><br>
            The Carl-Henning Pedersen & Else Alfelt Museum was inaugurated in 1976 and originally consisted of a circular 
            exhibition building. In 1993, the museum was expanded with a three-sided pyramid, and in 2015, the former shirt 
            factory Angligården was connected to the other museum buildings via two new large exhibition halls underground.
            <br><br>
            On Saturday 25 June 2022, a large part of Prince Henrik's popular sculpture collection was handed over to the 
            museum. Queen Margrethe II visited the museum that day. For a number of years, the Queen has been depositing a 
            number of works from her private collection of the Prince's sculptures.

        <p>
            Søby Brunkulslejer (brown coal field) is situated by Søby in Kølkær parish aprox. 15 km south from Herning. 
            The brown coal fields cover a listed area at around 1000 hectare and it is estimated that there has been produced 
            around 50 million cubic metres of brown coal from the period 1940 - 1970.
            <br><br>
            Today, the area is a hilly nature area with lots of small lakes, but some of the area is dangerous to go to since 
            there are risks of slides.
            <br><br>
            North of Søby lies Søby sø which is not from the brown coal-digging but a natural heath lake.
            In 1939, the production in the fields started out little by little. At first it was by hand, shovel, wheelbarrow, 
            spade and horse carriage. Later the hand tools were supplemented with excavators and conveyer belts.
            <br><br>
            Quickly, a town developed around the fields - the houses being small sheds and barracks, railway carriages and 
            worn-out coaches. The area was called The Jutlandic Klondike.
            <br><br>
            Visit the fields and make your way around the small houses and experience how life as a brown coal-worker was.

            Randers is a city in Randers Municipality, Central Denmark Region on the Jutland 
            peninsula. It is Denmark's sixth-largest city, with a population of 62,802. Randers is the municipality's main 
            town and the site of its municipal council. By road it is 38.5 kilometres (23.9 mi) north of Aarhus, 43.8 
            kilometres (27.2 mi) east of Viborg, and 224 kilometres (139 mi) northwest of Copenhagen.
            <br><br>
            Randers became a thriving market town in medieval times, and many of its 15th-century half-timbered houses remain 
            today, as does St Martin's Church, also from that period. Trade by sea was facilitated through the Gudenå River, 
            entering Randers Fjord. During industrialization, Randers quickly became one of the most important industrial 
            towns in the country, but it saw itself outpaced by the cities of Aarhus and Aalborg at the beginning of the 20th 
            century. Most of the larger historic industries in Randers are gone today. From 1970, the population saw a decline 
            from a peak of 58,500 citizens, until a stabilization in the 1990s occurred, followed by a modest rise since then.
            <br><br>
            The main tourist attraction is Randers Tropical Zoo thanks to its artificial rainforest, the largest in Northern 
            Europe, its 350 varieties of plant and over 175 species of animals. The city's football team, Randers FC, play 
            their homes games at the AutoC Park Randers, and are in Denmark's first league, the Superligaen. The town is also 
            home to Randers rugby union club and Jutland RLFC, a rugby league team, as well as Randers Cimbria, a Basketligaen 
            team that took 2nd place in the 2013–2014 season.

            Denmark. The city is situated on the Gudenå River in the hilly and lush landscape of Søhøjlandet, 
            surrounded by Denmark's largest forest district and a great number of lakes. Silkeborg is also known as 
            Denmark's outdoor capital. The lakes between Silkeborg and Ry that are linked by the Gudenå, are known 
            collectively as Silkeborgsøerne (the Silkeborg lakes).[3] The city is divided along an east–west axis by the 
            lake of Silkeborg Langsø, which at the eastern side of the city, flows into the Gudenå River.

            Viborg, a city in central Jutland, Denmark, is the capital of both Viborg municipality and Region Midtjylland. 
            Viborg is also the seat of the Western High Court, the High Court for the 
            Jutland peninsula. Viborg Municipality is the second-largest Danish municipality, covering 3.3% of the country's

            Viborg is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, with Viking settlements dating back to the late 8th century. 
            Its central location gave the city great strategic importance, in political and religious matters, during the 
            Middle Ages. A motte-and-bailey-type castle was once located in the city. Viborg's name is a combination of two 
            Old Norse words: vé, meaning a holy place, and borg, meaning a fort, but the original name of the town was 
            Vvibiærgh, where -biærgh means hill.

            The area was severely troubled by sand drift, and around the year 1000, the sand completely covered the burial

            The Coastal Museum of Bangsbo is situated in the beautiful manor of Bangsbo. The manor dates back to 1364 and it 
            lies in the heart of the idyllic Bangsbo area.
            <br><br>
            The primary exhibition at the manor shows the life around 1900 when the manor was owned by the bon vivant Johan 
            Knudsen. Due to Johan Knudsen the manor of Bangsbo became a hot spot for some of the most known Scandinavian 
            writers and artists around 1900. They formed a cultural and festive fellowship called the Circle of Bangsbo. 
            Thus a visit to Bangsbo provides a walk in the footsteps of the Danish writer Herman Bang and a fascinating 
            glimpse of the colourful life at the manor.
            <br><br>
            Apart from the exhibitions and collections in the manor house the museum also shows a fascinating exhibition about 
            the German occupation in Denmark and Northern Jutland. The exhibition provides a poignant look into various tales

            <br><br>
            The unimpeded view from this height was the reason why the occupying German forces chose to establish the first 
            fortified position here as early as in April 1940, and why they maintained a presence at the location until the 
            liberation of Denmark. Initially, it was the German Air Force that installed a mobile battery of 8.8 cm 
            anti-aircraft guns here, but soon after – in May 1940 – this was replaced by a stationary battery of anti-aircraft 
            guns of the same calibre operated by the German Navy. These guns were subsequently replaced on three occasions,

            The most recent addition to Hjørring is the new city shopping centre, Metropol, which has led to a change in the 
            city centre as one of Hjørring's main streets, Østergade, has been closed to vehicular traffic and is now open 
            only for pedestrians and bicycles. Metropol which was inaugurated in March 2008, is located on Østergade and also 
            houses the city's public library.

            Frederikshavn and 108 kilometres (67 mi) northeast of Aalborg. The Port of Skagen is Denmark's main fishing port 
            and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 million people annually.
            <br><br>
            The name was applied originally to the peninsula but it now also refers to the town. The settlement began during 
            the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and 
            evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of impressionist artists now 
            known as the Skagen Painters.

            20 m, which brings the highest point of the mile 40 m above sea level. Since 1900 it has moved approx. 1750 m to 
            the east, and today it moves at an average rate of 15 m per year, which means that in 100–200 years it will have

            The Skagen Odde Nature Centre, on the northern tip of Denmark's Jutland, is a 
            museum devoted to the effects of sand, water, wind and light. It was designed in 1989 by Jørn Utzon, the 
            celebrated architect behind the Sydney Opera House. Under the leadership of his son Jan, the centre was completed 
            in 2000.
            <br><br>
            The fascinating natural effect of the peninsula inspired the creation of the Nature Centre. Two seas, the Kattegat 
            and the Skagerrak meet at its tip. Then there is the Råbjerg Mile, a huge moving sand dune, Grenen with its sandy 
            beach celebrated by the Skagen Painters and the special light for which Skagen is so famous. The objective of the 
            centre is to allow visitors to see, hear and understand more about sand, water, wind and light. Each of the 
            pavilions presents one of these elements in a special atmosphere created by sound and light. There are special 
            activities for children.
            <br><br>
            The centre is open from 11 am to 4 pm from 1 May until the third week in October.

        </h2>
        <img src="Images/Hanstholm Lighthouse.jpg" height="300px" width="100%" class="cover"/>
        <p>
            Hanstholm Lighthouse was built in 1842-43 near Hansted Church high on Hanstholmknuden. South of the lighthouse, a 
            residence for the lighthouse keeper was built, and the adjoining garden is a glorious, sheltered spot where 
            visitors can take a rest and eat the food they have brought with them.
            <br><br>
            The lighthouse is built to guide the ships in the dangerous journey around Hanstholmknuden, but it also serves as 
            the city's landmark that guides us forward and welcomes us. The lighthouse is 23 m high, and thanks to its high 
            location, the lighthouse emits light at a height of 65 m above sea level.
            <br><br>
            Hanstholm Lighthouse was Denmark's first rotating lens lighthouse, where the light was refracted by means of 
            lenses and collected in beams. In 1889, the lighthouse was no longer up to date, the lighthouse was raised and the 
            lens apparatus was electrified as the first in Denmark. A clockwork caused the device to rotate and flash, and the 
            lighthouse then, as now, showed three short flashes every 10 seconds.
            <br><br>
            The lighthouse at this time was the brightest in the whole world. The new technology was considerably more 
            extensive, and the building complex was expanded considerably, including engine rooms for the steam engines. 
            There was also a telegraph station and weather service attached to the lighthouse. The light from Hanstholm 
            Lighthouse was thus important for the passing ships, but the lighthouse also had other key functions for traffic 
            at sea.
            <br><br>
            Hanstholm Lighthouse is still in operation, but the operation is fully automated. There is access to the 
            lighthouse during the day; from here there are wide views of the northern part of the national park. After a 
            horough restoration of the lighthouse, Nationalpark Thy has an exhibition room at the lighthouse right next to 
            Hanstholm Tourist Information in the old machine hall.

            mainland of Denmark. If the weather is clear you will have a view of Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse and Hanstholm from 
            the top of the cliff.

            Besides giving an amazing view of the North Sea, the limestone cliff is home to many different bird species, 
            including kittiwakes, common puffins and northern fulmars.
            <br><br>
            Bulbjerg is constantly exposed to erosion by the violent waves of the North Sea, which engulfs large pieces of 
            limestone and spreads it out onto the shores next to Bulbjerg.

            have succeeded in creating an exciting environment that adds new life to the town and area. Every year, Klitmøller 
            sees a number of surf competitions. Since 2010, the village has hosted the international surfing championship Cold 
            Hawaii PWA World Cup with 32 of the best surfers in the world competing for the cup. During the years, the 
            interest in this competition has increased in Denmark and abroad. Since 2013, HRH Crown Prince Frederik has been 
            the patron of the PWA World Cup in Cold Hawaii.
            <br><br>
            The two reefs outside the coast to the south of the point of Ørhage contribute to making Klitmøller particularly 
            well-suited for different disciplines within the sport of surfing. The formation of huge waves facilitates wave-, 
            wind-, kite- and stand up paddle surfing. This is not solely for professionals, as a matter of fact, you can learn 
            the noble art of surfing if you visit the Cold Hawaii Surf Camp or WestWind Surf Shop Klitmøller.

            Gothic period, and in the late Gothic period (c. 1500) three extensions were added, i.e. tower, vestry and porch. 
            The baptismal font dates from c. 1300. It was created in Gothland limestone and decorated with engraved figures of 
            apostles and saints.
            <br><br>
            The canopy type altarpiece was painted in 1596 with catechism tablets.The pulpit in auricular style dates from 1625. 
            The organ has 15 stops distributed on two manuals and a pedal and was built by Gunnar F. Husteds Orgelbyggeri in

            Opened in 1927, the museum provides a picture of village life in Lolland and Falster in the 19th century. 
            The museum consists of 13 individual houses from the 17th to the 20th centuries, each illustrating how rustic 
            people of different professions lived and worked in former times, and thus expose to the public the ancient

            <br><br>
            When Maribo’s old village church burned down in 1596, the abbey church became the town’s new church. In 1803, 
            its status changed from church to cathedral.
            <br><br>
            The church has undergone a number of renovations over the years. In the 1890s, however, the cathedral was 
            restored to its original appearance, and today it is a representation of how it may have looked during the 
            Middle Ages.

            received trade privileges in 1266, during the reign of king Erik V Glipping. Once the export center of western 
            Lolland, Nakskov thrived on trade, commerce and industry. This changed gradually as overland traffic was enabled 
            by a railway to the neighboring island of Falster in 1875.

            dates to the same period.
            <br><br>
            Remains of a wooden church from c. 1000 were unearthed in the 1950s. It was replaced by a brick church 
            dedicated to Saint Nicholas which is first mentioned in 1398 although its oldest sections probably date from 
            the early 13th century. It was completed in the second half of the 17th century. Major repairs were carried out in 
            1746 but further work proved necessary in 1825. Before the Danish Reformation, the church had a series of chapels 
            and altars, each connected with the craftsmen's guilds in the town. Much of the documentation was destroyed when 
            the Lübeckers plundered Nakskov in 1510.

        <p>
            The Viking Ship Museum (Vikingeskibsmuseet) on the banks of Roskilde fjord is one of Denmark's top tourist 
            attractions. Dedicated to the history of seafaring and boat building in ancient and medieval times, it contains 
            rare surviving examples of original Viking ships that were deliberately sunk at the harbor mouth to prevent 
            raiders from attacking the city.
            <br><br>
            The museum consists of eight buildings with very different functions, including a shipyard where reconstructions 
            of Viking ships and traditional Nordic wooden boats are built, and an activity center where adults and children 
            can try out their skills at Viking Age crafts.
            <br><br>
            This truly is a must-see for all those fascinated by Viking times and culture, and a visit here is an easy day 
            trip from Copenhagen. Guided tours are available in peak season.

        <p>
            Exhibits in the Roskilde Museum are housed in two of the city's oldest historic houses - "Sukkerhuset" and 
            "Liebes Gård." Although the focus is on history, the exhibits are 21st-century, with engaging interactive features 
            that tell the story of Roskilde through archaeological finds and a widely varied collection of other artifacts. 
            The picture it gives of local life goes well beyond Roskilde's own history, encompassing the Viking era, Denmark's 
            political past and present, even the role of religion in Danish life. The museum's Caféen Freunde is a good place 
            for a lunch break.

            Roskilde Palace is a four-wing yellow Baroque building built between 1733 and 1736 on the site where the vicarage once 
            stood. The Absalon Arch connects Roskilde Cathedral with the palace, which was once the residence of the Royal Family when 
            they were passing through or attending royal funerals.
            <br><br>
            From 1835 to 1848 the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm of the Islands, who formulated a new Danish Constitution, was 
            housed here. Today, there are two exhibitions on-site: the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Palace Wing. The garden is 
            used for exhibitions, concerts, and other cultural events.

            Slagelse is a town on Zealand, Denmark. The town is the seat of Slagelse Municipality, and is the biggest town of 
            the municipality. It is located 15 km east of Korsør, 16 km north-east of Skælskør, 33 km south-east of Kalundborg 
            and 14 km west of Sorø.
            <br><br>
            Slagelse has been inhabited since at least the Viking Age, where it was a Pagan site. Trelleborg, a ring castle, 
            was built near the current location of Slagelse in 980, which made the location strategically important. A church 
            was built at Slagelse's current location in the 1000s. Around this time, coins were minted in Slagelse.
            <br><br>
            Slagelse was granted the status of a market town in 1288 by Eric V. This gave the town a series of privileges, 
            though eventually put it in competition with the neighboring market towns of Korsør and Skælskør. In the 1780s a 
            road from Copenhagen to Korsør was built, and this road ran through Slagelse.

            <br><br>
            It served as the Scandinavian headquarters of the Order, known also as "the Hospitallers", and the prior of Antvorskov 
            reported directly to the great officer of the Order in Germany, the Grand Master of the Order on Rhodes (and, later, on 
            Malta), and the pope. As a result, Antvorskov was one of the most important monastic houses in Denmark. Before the 
            Reformation, its prior often served as a member of the Council of State (Danish: rigsråd) as well.

            Vordingborg is an old ferry town in Vordingborg Municipality in Denmark with around 18,000 inhabitants. 
            Because of three large estates surrounding the town, a coherent urban development has not been possible, which is 
            the reason why three satellite towns (former villages) have emerged around the town. Within the ring of estates, 
            the town has 12,000 inhabitants, and 17,868 inhabitants when including the three satellite towns of Ørslev, Nyråd, 
            and Stensved, situated 1, 3 and 5 kilometres, respectively, from the town of Vordingborg. Vordingborg Municipality

        <img src="Images/Vordingborg Castle.jpg" height="300px" width="100%" class="cover"/>
        <p>
            The castle was built in 1175 by King Valdemar I of Denmark as a defensive fortress, and as a base from which to launch 
            raids against the German coast. His half-brother built another castle in a remote location, which is now Copenhagen. King 
            Valdemar II similarly used the castle for expansion into the Baltic, and in 1241, it was where he created the reformed 
            legal system, the Code of Jutland. By the time of King Valdemar IV, the castle had nine towers and a defensive wall, 800 
            metres long.
            <br><br>
            Large parts of the castle were demolished after the Swedish wars had ended, in order to construct a palace for Prince 
            George, son of King Frederick III. The prince never took up residence, and the palace too was demolished in the 18th 
            century. Three manors were constructed nearby, including Iselingen, which became a meeting place for many leading artists 
            and scientists during the 1800s.
            <br><br>
            Today Vordingborg Castle is a ruin, although parts of the fourteenth century ring walls remain. The only fully 
            preserved part of the castle, the 26 meter tall Goose Tower (Gåsetårnet), is the symbol of the city. The name 
            comes from the golden goose that perches on top of the tower's spire. Although legend has it that Valdemar 
            Atterdag used the symbol to taunt the Hanseatic League, the truth is the goose was first erected in 1871. 
            The tower was transferred into the national trust on December 24, 1808, and was thus the first, protected historic 
            monument in Denmark.

            In 1912, it was decided to build a brick barracks with food, workshops and accommodation facilities in Vordingborg. 
            In 1914, a state-paid administration building was ready, which today is known as Building 1 (Commandant Building). 
            Municipal construction, including building 101 (Dannevirke), began in August 1912 and was ready for occupancy in 
            April 1913.

            <br><br>
            There are only shifting exhibitions at the castle, so if you visit at intervals, there will always be something new to

            The sculpture was designed by Svend Wiig Hansen and unveiled in 1995 to celebrate Esbjerg's 100th anniversary as an 
            independent municipality. Designed to portray man meeting with nature, it has something of a mystical aura reminiscent of

        <p>
            Fredericia Ramparts is a green oasis with a rich nature and wild life, which can be experienced from the many 
            trails in the area. The trails passes by wild thickets, the lowlaying areas around the moats, The Playground of 
            The Ramparts and grassland. If you're lucky, you might be able to see a flag woodpecker or a roe deer on your 
            hiking trip. The Ramparts has several lookout pointsas well, which provides a great view over the town of 
            Fredericia and The Little Belt.
            <br><br>
            If you need a break during your tour around the fortification, you can use the benches and tables, which are 
            placed along the hiking trails. You can also make a stop and explore the many old canons, which are placed on the 
            bastions and close to The White Water Tower, or visit The Statue of The Brave Soldier, the landmark of Fredericia. 
            Because The Ramparts continues all the way to the seaside, you can combine your hiking trip with a trip to the 
            family-friendly beach Østerstrand as well.
            <br><br>
            The trails which cover the fortification are about 18 km long altogether and easy accessed from many stairs and 
            paths on both sides af The Ramparts. Because of this, The Ramparts is not only a tourist attraction or a hiking 
            spot but also a passageway to the city-centre of Fredericia and is used by the locals as an urban park.
            <br><br>
            The Ramparts is of the biggest urban parks in Denmark and now adorned by many beautiful old trees. But back in the 
            days, when the fortification was an active military fortress, the only growth on the area were grass and hawthorne. 
            The hawthorne was planted at the draff between the inner slopes of the rampart and the moat and served as barbed wire at 
            that time. The hawthorne plantation were maintained by a "Thorne Master" who had the job of weaving the hawthorne branches 
            into an impenetrable network. Hawthorne are still a dominating plantation on The Ramparts today.

            Hannerup Forest and Fuglsang Forest form a large contiguous natural area, which offers a wealth of opportunities 
            for outdoor activities.
            <br><br>
            In the forests you will find marked footpaths, as well as a marked path for the visually impaired. If you're up 
            for it, there is a mountain bike track, which is about 8 kilometers long and about 225 m in altitude. It is 
            signposted and suitable for most levels of riders. In addition, you will also find a good riding trail in the 
            forest.
            <br><br>
            Close to the parking lot at Fuglsang Forest, you can visit a fenced deer park with fallow deer. You may be lucky 
            enough to get quite close to the animals. If you want to feed the deer, you may bring apples and carrots 
            (other types of food e.g. pasta and bread is bad for the animals). In Fuglsang forest, you will also find a forest 
            playground with tables, benches, and room for play for both young and old children.
            <br><br>
            You will also find a children's playground, with tables and benches by the parking lot at Hannerup Forest. Here is 
            a large area with different playing fields, which may be used when free. 
            <br><br>
            If you walk past the ball courts across the bridge road, you will come to a memorial. On a hilltop stands a stone 
            column commemorating that here lay one of the German bastions from which Fredericia was besieged in 1849. Below 
            the hill is a lion fountain. In the westernmost part of the forest is Sortebro, which connects Hannerup Forest and 
            Fuglsang Forest. Here stands one of the forest's oldest oak trees, which is several hundred years old.
            <br><br>
            The area lends itself well to a picnic in the green and is a lovely scenic area, which is definitely worth a visit.

            Haderslev
        </h1>
        <p>
            Haderslev is situated in a valley, leading from Vojens to Haderslev Fjord and the Baltic Sea. Haderslev was 
            presumably founded by Vikings at least a century before it was granted status as royal borough in 1292. At that 
            time, it had become one of the main trading centres in Southern Jutland. In 1327, Haderslevhus, the royal castle, 
            was mentioned for the first time. It was situated east of the cathedral, in an area still called Slotsgrunden. 
            <br><br>
            In the following centuries the city prospered, building both the Gothic Cathedral and the second castle of 
            Hansborg (burnt in 1644), which was similar to Kronborg. Due to the plague in Copenhagen, King Christian IV was 
            married there. In the 16th century, the city became one of the first Scandinavian centres of Lutheranism during 
            the Reformation. Prior to the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Haderslev was situated in the Duchy of Schleswig, a 
            Danish fief, so its history is properly included in the contentious history of Schleswig-Holstein. 
            <br><br>
            From 1864 it was part of Prussia, and as such part of the North German Confederation, and from 1871 onwards, part 
            of the German Empire. In the 1920 Schleswig Plebiscite that returned Northern Schleswig to Denmark, 38.6% of 
            Haderslev's inhabitants voted for remaining part of Germany and 61.4% voted for the cession to Denmark. It was 
            formerly the capital of the German Kreis Hadersleben and the Danish Haderslev County.

            deer and 20 red deer in the deer park and around 70 calves are born every year. There are ample opportunities to 
            see both red deer and fallow deer, which often move around in herds and like the open areas. There are 4 
            entrances/gates to the deer park and a number of paths, which are also suitable for disabled visitors. You are 
            advised to keep to these to avoid scaring the animals.

            a significant part of his childhood and youth here. The Castle lost its importance as more and more of the duties

        <p>
            In the center of Funen, Denmark's garden island, which is filled with magnificent manor houses and palaces, Odense 
            is named after the Norse God of war, wisdom, and poetry, Odin.
            <br><br>
            It is best known to tourists as the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen, author of some of the most treasured 
            fairy tales. Its most popular tourist attractions are his childhood home and the excellent Hans Christian Andersen 
            Museum. The museum will take you into the world of his imagination, and if you want to see more of the magical 
            land that provided his literary inspiration, follow the Hans Christian Andersen Trail to discover 15 manor houses 
            and castles in Funen that are connected to his life or writing.
            <br><br>
            The city is easily reached from Copenhagen, either a drive of less than two hours, or by direct train through 
            beautiful countryside.

            Dating from 1908 and dedicated to the writer's life and work, the Hans Christian Andersen Museum explores 
            Andersen's world through artifacts, mementos, and exhibits. Of particular interest are his drawings and artwork. 
            The interactive installations include a PC that allows you to leaf through his books. At the listening posts, you 
            can hear his stories and poems.
            <br><br>
            The museum shop has a wide selection of books in several languages, both about and by Hans Christian Andersen. 
            The domed hall is adorned with scenes from the autobiographical book Story of My Life.
            <br><br>
            To the southwest of Odense Cathedral, in Munkemøllestræde (3-5), you'll find Hans Christian Andersen's childhood 
            home (Andersen's Barndomshjem) with a memorial plaque on the gable end. Andersen lived here from 1807-1819. The 
            building is now a branch of the main museum.

        <p>
            Less than 30 minutes' drive from Odense is the fairy tale Egeskov Castle, the best preserved moat-castle in Europe. The 
            current structure was built by Frands Brockenhuus and completed in 1554.
            <br><br>
            Although the scene is placid now, this outstanding Renaissance building began as a defensive structure at a time of 
            political and religious unrest. To protect it from attack, it was sited in the middle of a lake and with walls 
            thick enough to enclose stairways and a well to provide water in the event of a siege.
            <br><br>
            Over the centuries, the castle has changed hands many times and later became a model farm. A Veteran Car Museum 
            opened here in 1967, and other tourist attractions include a treetop walk and Segway tours. The Banqueting Hall is 
            magnificent, and the setting of this beautiful castle is breathtaking.
            <br><br>
            From Egeskov Castle, you can travel 15 kilometers to Svendborg and board a ferry to the picturesque island of Aero 
            with its quaint cottages and cobbled lanes.

            Originally constructed as an engine workshop for DSB and the private North Funen Railway Company, the roundhouse 
            is now an impressive exhibition space, where you can experience the history of Danish railways.
            <br><br>

        <p>
            To the south of Odense Town Hall, St. Knud's Cathedral (Skt. Knuds Kirke) is named after the Danish saint, Knud IV, 
            who began building the structure around 1100. The original church was burned down in the 12th century, and after a 
            further great fire, a three-aisled replacement was started in the 1300s. In fact, it took almost 200 years to 
            complete.
            <br><br>
            A notable feature of the interior is the crypt below the choir, which contains the tombs of King Knud, his brother 
            Benedict, and various other kings and their consorts. Behind the High Altar stands a huge reredos with magnificent
            carvings.
            <br><br>
            Other points of interest are the epitaphs, the bronze font of 1620, and the pulpit dating from 1750. To the east 
            of the cathedral, a park named after Hans Christian Andersen (H.C. Andersen Haven), complete with a statue of the 
            writer, stretches along the waterfront.

            Close to the Flakhaven and Town Hall is the Møntergården Museum, a compendium of local and cultural history housed 
            in a former mint that dates from 1646. The complex includes typical Odense houses from the 16th and 17th centuries, 
            as well as a Baroque warehouse.
            <br><br>
            The buildings are furnished with interiors of various periods, and there are collections of local costumes, 
            ceramics, ecclesiastical art, toys, silver, clocks, and coins. The "Odense in the Middle Ages" exhibition is 
            particularly interesting. A newer building houses the exhibition, "Funen–Center of the Universe."
            <br><br>
            Families – and others following the Hans Christian Anderson Trail – will enjoy The Tinderbox Culture Centre for

            the Viking marketplace flourished, and the museum’s Viking Age exhibition is packed with beautiful objects from the 
            workshops of the bead maker, the bronze caster and the comb maker.

            The exhibition about Ribe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance tells about daily life: play, health and sickness - about 
            religious houses and churches and about the ongoing profitable trading in the town. The story is told in so many different

        <p>
            Dybbøl Mill is one of Denmark's most important national symbols. During the war of 1864, it became the symbol of 
            the bravery of the Danish soldiers on the battlefield, and in the period 1864-1920 the symbol of the struggle of 
            the Danish-minded southern Jutlanders under German rule. At the same time, it was a completely ordinary mill, 
            which was run until 1990.
            <br><br>
            Today, the mill is a museum. On the ground floor of the grain magazine, there is an exhibition about the history 
            of the mill 1744-2020. Here you can learn more about the influence of the two Schleswig Wars on the mill and about 
            the family who lived there at the time. On the magazine loft, you will find an exhibition about Dybbøl as a symbol 
            and about the many national celebrations - both Danish and German - that have taken place at Dybbøl Banke.
            <br><br>
            In the mill tower, you can see the old grinders and the big spur wheel. Afterwards you can go out on to the 
            gallery and enjoy the beautiful view of Dybbøl Banke, Sønderborg and Vemmingbund.

            The result of the war in 1864 was the collapse of the multinational Danish state. Denmark was decreased by 40% in 
            land area and reduced by about 38.5 % in population. After WW1, a part of the land area of Schleswig was returned 
            in 1920 - known today as South Jutland. Prussia became the expanding German empire, which later on abolished and 
            since became a part of the federal state of Germany, as we know it today. That is why you will experience a 
            crucial chapter in the history of Europe at the history centre.
